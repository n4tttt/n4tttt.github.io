<h1> The origins of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"><i>Cecil</i></a></h1>
<p> He is our saviour. He is our protector. He is our <i>deity</i>.</p>
<p> Before the great one we were nothing but sheep without a shepherd, we were truely lost. He brought us hope and meaning. He gave our lives purpose. For that we praise him.</p>
<p> He came to us when we were blinded, when we were lost in the darkness of sin and society. He rescued us. He lead us to salvation.</p>
